# Shop, the simple version controller

Shop is a version controller meant to be simple and a joy to use. Those are its only
goals; goals do not include, **speed**, **size**, or, lest you divulge secrets with
this humble tool, **security**. Maybe in the future these goals will be added; for now,
the answer is no.

Shop currently has a very limited set of commands: `init`, `save`, `backup`, and `restore`.
Further information will be added later.

Shop stores all of its information in one file: `.shop`. If this becomes unwieldy, I'll try to
use delta encoding.

Shop is, as of now, not ready to be used. Don't use it.
